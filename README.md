Magic of the Egyptians is a game that me and a colleague from my class made together.

Programming and level design: Marin Bogdanović
Graphic design: Petar Beronić

# Idea:
Our teacher made up the idea for the game, he made the game concept.

# Story:
On a haunted night, a truck with ancient Egyptian artifacts was parked outside a museum, when suddenly the mummies became sentient. Our hero is an ex-soldier who lives close by so he decided to investigate. When he came close he realized what had happened, he didn't have time to waste, he had to stop them immediately before they came into the village. He has to destroy the magic book that keeps the mummies alive.

# Inspiration:
We were inspired by the original Doom from 1993 and similar games such as Quake and Wolfenstein 3D.

# Game production:
Because of our lack of knowledge in 3D modeling, we decided to use rotating sprites for our models, staying true to our inspirations.
